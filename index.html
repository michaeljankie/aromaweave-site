            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>AromaWeave® stickers are engineered using premium cotton-rayon fiber, a material that integrates advanced scientific principles with the inherent properties of natural cellulose. This page provides a detailed examination of the material composition of these stickers, focusing on the scientific basis for their construction and performance. Designed for optimal functionality, the cotton-rayon fiber blend exemplifies a synergy between natural luxury and cutting-edge material science.</p>

            <h2>Material Composition: Premium Cotton-Rayon Fiber</h2>
            <h3>What is Cotton-Rayon Fiber?</h3>
            <p>The stickers are crafted from a hybrid fiber composed of natural cotton and rayon, a regenerated cellulose material. This combination is deliberately selected to exploit the complementary attributes of each component:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cotton:</strong> A natural polymer consisting of β-1,4-linked D-glucose units, cotton forms long, linear cellulose chains. These chains contribute to the fiber’s breathability, softness, and structural flexibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Rayon:</strong> Derived from wood pulp via the viscose process, rayon is a semi-synthetic fiber with a semi-crystalline structure. It enhances the blend’s durability, smoothness, and capacity for liquid retention.</li>
                <li><strong>Blend Characteristics:</strong> The cotton-rayon fiber in AromaWeave® stickers is formulated with a precise ratio to achieve a balance of strength, porosity, and absorbency. This creates a matrix ideally suited for retaining and releasing compounds, such as essential oils, with scientific precision.</li>
            </ul>
