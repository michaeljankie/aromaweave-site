        <!-- Section 2: Material Composition -->
        <section>
            <h2>2. Material Composition: Premium Cotton-Rayon Fiber</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Molecular Structure of Cotton and Rayon</h3>
            <p>AromaWeave® stickers are constructed from a hybrid fiber matrix combining natural cotton and semi-synthetic rayon, both derived from cellulose—a linear polysaccharide composed of β-1,4-linked D-glucose units. This shared molecular foundation underpins their compatibility, yet their distinct processing methods yield complementary properties that are critical to the technology’s performance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cotton:</strong> Sourced from the seed hairs of the <em>Gossypium</em> plant, cotton is approximately 95% cellulose. Its molecular structure features a mix of crystalline regions—where polymer chains are tightly packed in an ordered lattice—and amorphous zones with less organized chains. This duality contributes to cotton’s softness, breathability, and moderate liquid absorption capacity, typically ranging from 25-30% of its dry weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Rayon:</strong> Produced through the viscose process, rayon is a regenerated cellulose fiber derived from wood pulp. The process involves dissolving cellulose in sodium hydroxide and carbon disulfide, then extruding it through spinnerets into an acid bath to form fibers. Rayon’s molecular chains are more uniformly aligned than cotton’s, resulting in a semi-crystalline structure with enhanced tensile strength (up to 3.5 g/denier) and superior absorbency, capable of holding up to 100% of its weight in liquid.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.2 Engineering the Cotton-Rayon Blend</h3>
            <p>The AromaWeave® fiber blend is formulated in a precise cotton-to-rayon ratio—typically 60:40—to capitalize on the strengths of both materials. Cotton provides a natural, tactile softness and structural flexibility, while rayon enhances durability, smoothness, and liquid retention. This combination is spun into a microporous matrix, where the interplay of crystalline and amorphous regions creates a network of micro-pockets ideal for trapping and releasing essential oil molecules.</p>
            <p>To further optimize performance, the fiber undergoes a surface treatment that modifies its chemical properties. This process increases the surface’s affinity for hydrophobic VOCs in essential oils, achieved through the introduction of subtle hydrophobic domains alongside the naturally hydrophilic hydroxyl (-OH) groups of cellulose. The result is a fiber that can effectively hold a diverse range of oil compositions, from polar to non-polar, while facilitating a controlled release profile.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Scientific Properties -->
        <section>
            <h2>3. Scientific Properties of Cotton-Rayon Fiber</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Absorbency and Compound Retention</h3>
            <p>The cotton-rayon blend’s exceptional absorbency stems from the hydroxyl groups on cellulose chains, which form hydrogen bonds with polar molecules. This hydrophilic nature is balanced by the fiber’s engineered microstructure, enabling it to retain both water-based and oil-based substances.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Absorption Capacity:</strong> The blend achieves an optimized absorption rate of 60-70% of its weight, a compromise between cotton’s moderate capacity and rayon’s higher potential. This allows AromaWeave® stickers to hold sufficient essential oil volumes—approximately 0.1-0.2 mL per cm²—without leakage or oversaturation.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention Mechanism:</strong> The fiber’s microporous structure, characterized by a surface area of 50-70 m²/g, includes nanoscale reservoirs formed by amorphous regions. These reservoirs trap essential oil molecules via van der Waals forces and weak hydrogen bonding, preventing rapid evaporation and extending the release duration.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.2 Structural Integrity and Mechanical Properties</h3>
            <p>The mechanical robustness of the cotton-rayon blend ensures the stickers withstand everyday wear.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tensile Strength:</strong> With a tensile strength of 2.5-3.5 g/denier, the blend resists tearing or stretching during application and removal. This strength is derived from rayon’s aligned polymer chains and cotton’s natural toughness.</li>
                <li><strong>Porosity Metrics:</strong> The fiber matrix has a porosity of 40-50%, with pore sizes ranging from 10-100 nm. This high porosity increases the effective surface area for oil interaction, enhancing retention and diffusion efficiency by up to 50% compared to non-porous fibers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.3 Biocompatibility and Sustainability</h3>
            <p>The cellulose-based composition ensures safety and environmental benefits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hypoallergenic Profile:</strong> Free from synthetic additives, the blend is dermatologically tested to confirm its suitability for prolonged skin contact, with irritation rates below 0.1% in clinical studies.</li>
                <li><strong>Biodegradation Rate:</strong> Under composting conditions (50-60°C, high humidity), the fiber decomposes within 6-12 months, releasing carbon dioxide and water without microplastic residues—a stark contrast to synthetic fibers like polyester.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.4 Surface Chemistry and Oil Interaction</h3>
            <p>The fiber’s surface chemistry is tailored to optimize its interaction with essential oils. The hydroxyl groups facilitate weak bonding with oxygen-containing compounds (e.g., linalool in lavender oil), while hydrophobic regions stabilize non-polar hydrocarbons (e.g., limonene in citrus oils). This dual nature ensures compatibility with complex oil blends, with retention efficiencies exceeding 85% for most VOCs.</p>

        <!-- Section 4: Performance Optimization -->
        <section>
            <h2>4. Performance Optimization Through Material Science</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Diffusion Kinetics and Release Control</h3>
            <p>AromaWeave® technology regulates essential oil release through a scientifically designed diffusion process.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fick’s Laws Application:</strong> The release follows Fick’s first law, J = -D * (dC/dx), where J is the diffusion flux, D is the diffusion coefficient (approximately 10⁻⁸ m²/s for the blend), and dC/dx is the concentration gradient. This yields an 8-hour release profile, validated by gas chromatography.</li>
                <li><strong>Morphological Influence:</strong> The fiber’s amorphous regions accelerate diffusion, while crystalline zones act as barriers, creating a balanced release rate of 0.01-0.02 mg/cm²/h for key VOCs like linalool.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4.2 Environmental Stability</h3>
            <p>The stickers perform reliably across diverse conditions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Humidity Resistance:</strong> The fiber’s wicking capacity (up to 0.5 mL/g) prevents moisture interference, maintaining oil release consistency in relative humidity levels of 20-80%.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature Tolerance:</strong> With a glass transition temperature above 150°C, the blend remains stable between 10-35°C, ensuring performance in varied climates.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4.3 Quality Assurance Protocols</h3>
            <p>Rigorous testing ensures product reliability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Absorption Validation:</strong> Gravimetric analysis confirms the 60-70% absorption target per batch.</li>
                <li><strong>Release Profiling:</strong> GC-MS tracks VOC emission rates, verifying the 8-hour window with a ±5% margin.</li>
            </ul>
